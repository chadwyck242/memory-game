# Memory Game

Memory Game project as a part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer NanoDegree

## Getting Started

8 pairs of cards are dealt, for a total of 16 cards.
You can click on each card to find the match, and if
a match is found, those cards will remain open. Upon
matching all the cards you will receive a congratulations modal
with your final number of moves, final game duration, and final star
rating based on your performance.

### Features
* Responsive Design. Flexbox and Grid Layouts combine to make this game playable on many devices and screens.
* A move counter that tracks how many total moves you have used, which is returned at the end.
* A Star Rating system that dynamically updates during the game and is also returned at the end.
* And finally a game duration timer that starts at the completion of the first turn and stops once game is won.
* A modal that returns all the above game information, as well a restart and play again buttons.


## Items to Add Later
* Would like to learn more CSS Animation techniques and add them to the cards.
* Continue tweaking the responsiveness of the game for more screen and device sizes.
* A score keeping and leaderboard system once my JavaScript abilities have improved to that point.


## Deployment

This will be a Github Pages project and will be playable from that location. In the future I will try
to learn other deployment strategies and share my projects to a wider audience.
